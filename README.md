# TextAreaValidation-
Text Area Validation

Created a simple text area where the user can type a message, and implement a real-time character counter. 
The counter updates as the user types, displaying the number of characters typed and the remaining characters allowed. 

• Created a HTML text area and displayed the maximum allowed characters "Maximum 200 characters allowed"

• Added an event listener that tracks the input event to update the character counter in real time. 

 • Displayed a message that shows how many characters have been typed and how many are remaining "Remaining 150/200 characters allowed" 

 • If the user exceeds 200 character, prevented further typing and display a warning message "Maximum charaters entered".
